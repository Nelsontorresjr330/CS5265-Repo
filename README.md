## Confusion Table
| | Team A Wins | Team A Losses |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Predict Team A Win | True Positive | False Positive |
| Predict Team A Loss | False Negative | True Negative|

For my project, I will be working on creating a model capable of predicting NFL game results. All my data is publically accessable through the NFL's API and I will be using a dataset provided by FiveThirtyEight (https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) so there is no cost to calculate or scrape the data. 

My above confusion table is fairly simple, a true positive is predicting team A wins correctly, a true negative is predicting a loss correctly and false results are included as well.

If I can reach a model that can predict games about 60% of the time properly, I will consider the model a success.
