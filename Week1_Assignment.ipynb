Their nfl-elo dataset hosts 17380 rows and 33 columns with date, boolean, integer, string, and float data types. To fit the assignment description a bit better I can widdle down the number of columns since I dont think they will all be necessary."

To determine how well my model works, I will compare the model's predicted score to the true end result and the closer the model is to the actual score, the better the model. Ideally, my model will be able to predict around 60% of the games correctly."
